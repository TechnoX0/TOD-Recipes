    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To make this rich mac and cheese recipe healthier we use whole wheat bread crumbs, low-fat milk and cheese, whole wheat noodles, and reduced the amount of butter.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package whole wheat macaroni</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded low-fat cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups low-fat (1%) milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole wheat bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</p>
            <p>Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour to make a roux. Slowly add milk to roux, stirring constantly.</p>
            <p>Stir in Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and sauce is thick, about 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Place macaroni in large baking dish and pour sauce over macaroni. Stir well.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir until butter is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Spread over macaroni to cover. Sprinkle with paprika.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in preheated oven until cheese sauce is hot and breadcrumbs are browned, about 30 minutes.</p>
